# Some JS Basics

## Instructions
You will write two functions to help Twitter users.
* countChars just returns the number of characters in a string
* addHashtag adds #yolo to a string

This lab has built in tests. To run them, you just have to open "tweet_test.html" in a browser. To re-run the tests, simply refresh your page. Initially, the two tests will fail.

Put your solution code in "tweets.js" and get both tests to pass.
