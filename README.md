# JavaScript Functions - Tweet Helper

## Instructions
You will write two functions to help Twitter users.
* countChars() - returns the number of characters in a string
* addHashtag()- adds #yolo to a string and then returns that new string
* excitedTweet() - upcases a user's string and adds three exclamation points

This lab has built in tests. To run them, open "tweet_test.html" in a browser. To re-run the tests, simply refresh your page. Initially, the two tests will fail. Don't worry, failing tests are normal when you start a lab. This just means that your code doesn't pass the specifications laid out in the 'spec' folder. You can check out the 'specs' by opening the spec folder and looking at tweets.spec.js.

Put your solution code in "tweets.js" and get both tests to pass.
